Version: 0.1.0
Author: John Haman
Maintainer: John Haman <jhaman@ida.org>
Description: Functions for automatically appending uncertainy intervals, and other
    quantities of interest to data frames. This package has a "data frame first" syntax
    that allows for easy piping. Currently supported models include linear and log-linear
    models, linear mixed models, and some generalized linear models Poisson and Logistic
    models.
