* Short Term
- Add more GLMs to add_pi (currently only handles Poisson model)
- Edit Vignettes
- Implement a parametric method for GLM prediction intervals.
- reorder columns of new data if they are not already in the right order
- Display version and build date on load
- Develop set of test functions (testthat plus test folder)
* Long Term
- Add survival models method
- Add GLMMs method
- Zero-Inflated Poisson models?
