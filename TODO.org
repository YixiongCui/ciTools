* Short Term
- Add more GLMs to add_pi (currently only handles Poisson model)
- Implement a parametric method for GLM prediction intervals.
- reorder columns of new data if they are not already in the right order
- Merge in vignettes
- Display version and build date on load
- Develope set of test functions (testthat plus test folder)

* Long Term
- Add survival models method
- Add GLMMs method
- Zero-Inflated Poisson models?
